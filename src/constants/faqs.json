    "question": "What is a smart meter? Do I need one?",
    "answer": "Smart meters record your energy usage in real-time and securely communicates the data. It's not mandatory to have a smart meter, but most iO Energy customers do. They allow time-of-use pricing, enable more accurate billing, eliminate the need for manual meter readings, and provide you with valuable insight into your energy consumption."

    "question": "What if I use power outside of the daytime?",
    "answer": "If you primarily use electricity during off-peak hours, you're already on the right track for saving money with our Time of Use pricing. Our plans are designed to reward customers who can adjust their energy consumption to take advantage of lower rates during these times. However, even if you use less power during the day, you can still benefit from a smart meter and gain more control over your energy usage and billing accuracy."
